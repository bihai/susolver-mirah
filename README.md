SuSolver
========

A Sudoku Solver written in Mirah for the JVM.

Solves with logic but has a brute force option.

Current State
-------------

The backend is functional if incomplete.  It can be used to create whatever kind of frontend and solves most sudoku puzzles.

The Swing frontend is also functional and definitely incomplete.  At some point I'll include a screenshot.

The CodenameOne project, made possible by Steve Hannah's NetBeans plugin for Mirah (https://github.com/shannah/mirah-nbm) is not currently functional.

Current ruby scripts for running, compiling and creating jars outside of NetBeans only have Windows in mind at the moment.
